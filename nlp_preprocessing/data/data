At the Lester Patrick Awards lunch, Bill Torrey mentioned that one of his
options next season is to be president of the Miami team, with Bob Clarke
working for him.  At the same dinner, Clarke said that his worst mistake
in Philadelphia was letting Mike Keenan go -- in retrospect, almost all
players came realize that Keenan knew what it took to win.  Rumours are
now circulating that Keenan will be back with the Flyers.

Nick Polano is sick of being a scapegoat for the schedule made for the
Red Wings; After all, Bryan Murray approved it.

Gerry Meehan and John Muckler are worried over the Sabres' prospects;
Assistant Don Lever says that the Sabres have to get their share now,
because a Quebec dynasty is emerging ...

The Mighty Ducks have declared that they will not throw money around
loosely to buy a team.

Oilers coach Ted Green remarked that ""There some guys around who can
fill Tie Domi's skates, but none who can fill his helmet.""

Senators' Andrew McBain told off a security guard at Chicago Stadium
who warned him of the stairs leading down to the locker room; McBain
mouthed off at him, after all being a seasoned professional ... and
tumbled down the entire steep flight.

  You haven't fully explained the atheist position.  Many theists believe that
there is ""no proof of the existence of God"" but choose to believe in him
anyway.  I haven't yet found an argument for atheism that can't quickly be
broken down to unprovable assumptions.  This isn't a problem with me (everybody
needs to have a faith) but if you believe that you can provide a ""purely
logical"" argument for the nonexistence of God, I'd really like to see it.

  Ahh...but when you use science and reason, you have faith in certain beliefs
of the scientific method--for example:

  The physical laws of the universe are stable.
  Our observations of reality are a valid basis for a determination of truth.
  Objective reality exists.
  Logical argument is a valid way to answer all questions.

  Can you prove any of these?

I haven't followed whatever discussion there may have been on these
people, but I feel that C. S. Lewis is an excellent apologist and I
see no reason for embarrassment.  If you think that errors and flawed
arguments are a reason for dismissing a thinker, you must dismiss
nearly every thinker from Descartes to Kant; any philosophy course
will introduce you to their weaknesses.

I said nothing about ""the masses.""  However comparing ""the masses"" in
our day and in Aquinas' day really *is* odd.  Read Ortega y Gasset on
this.

I'm talking about the familiar experience of arguing all night and
winning on logic and evidence, only to discover your opponent to be
unaware, even intuitively, of things like entailment (let alone
pragmatics).  (I am assuming that both parties are college graduates
or better...)  Myself, I don't bother any more.

  Hello,

  I have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the
newsgroup, and I think that they can be used to explain each other.
Unfortunately I don't have direct quotes handy...

1) Atheists believe that when they die, they die forever.

2) A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death
   is unfair.

  I don't see what the problem is!  To Christians, Hell is, by definition,
eternal death--exactly what atheists are expecting when they die.  There's no
reason Hell has to be especially awful--to most people, eternal death is bad
enough.
  Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view, since
the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such.  Personally, I don't think
that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus
with a double-edged sword issuing from his mouth--I treat both these statements
as metaphorical.

As the subject suggests the Flames were not impressive this afternoon,
dropping a 6-3 decision to the LA Kings. Most of the Flames neglected
to show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at least
five posts! The Flames best line was probably
Skrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary
Suter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored
by D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made
some bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially
impressive.

The games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and
never recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches,
hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren
Rychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed
to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think
Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men,
as Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King
inserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's
game. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no
idea how serious - he didn't return.

I still think the Flames should win this series, but they better
buckle down.
